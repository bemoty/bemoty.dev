### About me

I'm Josh and I'm a software developer living in Austria, currently studying computer science at the [University of Innsbruck](https://uibk.ac.at/) and working as Head Developer for [GommeHD.net](https://gommehd.net/), a small video game company based in Germany. I have been coding full-stack applications for more than 6 years now and I'm always looking for new challenges.

Online, I'm also known by my pseudonym **bemoty**, which is a meaningless name I made up as a kid and have used online ever since.

### Why the smiley bag?

I drew a smiley on a bag, put it on my head and took a picture because I thought it looked cool and it's been my avatar/logo ever since.

I still think it looks cool.
