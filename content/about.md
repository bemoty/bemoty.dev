## who is bemoty

bemoty is me, **josh**. it's a name i made up when i was a kid and i've been using it ever since.

i'm a software developer studying computer science at the [university of innsbruck](https://uibk.ac.at/) and working as head developer at [gommehd.net](https://gommehd.net/).

besides programming, i'm also interested in music, design and (natural) languages.

## bemoty and the blockgame

one thing that especially caught my interest is [minecraft](https://minecraft.net). i went from casually playing the game back in 2011 to being part of the [minecraft bug tracker moderation team](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bug_tracker), proofreading the [german game+website translation](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft), administering one of the largest european [minecraft server networks](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GommeHD.net) and meeting a lot of awesome people along the way.

so naturally, the game has a special place in my heart and when someone knows me, they usually know me because of minecraft.

## who is that guy with the bag

it's me. i drew a smiley on a bag, put it on my head and took a picture because i thought it looked cool and it's been my avatar ever since.
