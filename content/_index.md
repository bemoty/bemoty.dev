            I am a software developer and Computer Science student based in Innsbruck, Austria.

Currently, I lead development at [GommeHD.net](https://gommehd.net/), where I keep the lights on for one of Europe's
largest Minecraft server networks. I spend most of my time optimizing and maintaining legacy Java backends, but I also
like creating modern web user interfaces, preferably with Next.js.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably [making music](https://soundcloud.com/bemoty), reading a
book, starting another Cyberpunk playthrough, or fiddling with my Arch installation and regretting it immediately.
