## Hi!

I'm Josh, a software developer living in Austria, currently studying computer science at the [University of Innsbruck](https://uibk.ac.at/) and working as Head Developer for [GommeHD.net](https://gommehd.net/), a small video game company based in Germany. I have been coding full-stack applications since I was 16, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

On the internet I'm also known by my pseudonym **bemoty**, which is a meaningless name I made up as a kid and have used online ever since.
