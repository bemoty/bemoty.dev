## About this blog

Hi, this post is really just a test for whether or not my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) blog setup is working as expected. So if you're reading this and you're not me, congratulations! You've found my website (in a working state)! ðŸŽ‰

I'm usually more a lurker than a poster, as can be seen by the activity of my [Twitter (not X) feed](https://twitter.com/bemoty), so the chances of me never posting something here are nonzero. But just in case something interesting happens in my life and I feel like sharing it, this is the place where it will happen.

```java {lineNos=inline}
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Code highlighting is working! Nice!");
    }
}
```

Anyway, thanks for stopping by and I hope you have a great day. <3
